# Data-Science-with-Python
With (The Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program) I have the opportunity to learn the most important programming languages data scientists use today. I started with the fascinating field of data science and learned Python, SQL, terminal, and Git with the help of experienced instructors. I was prepared to tackle real-world data analysis problems.
